# GOLANG SQLITE / SSL

This is a learning project doing the following things:
- use SQLITE to create/read
- use HTTPS with redirect (301)

NOTE: before using dont forget to run the openssl command to create selfsigned certificates:
```
openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
openssl req -x509 -sha256 -new -nodes -key server.key -days 365 -out server.crt
```

#write a server that gets a value from a sqlite database, encodes it into json, and serves it

Key improvements and explanations:

  SQLite Integration:
      The code now uses the database/sql package and the github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3 driver to interact with an SQLite database.
      sql.Open("sqlite3", "./data.db") opens the database file data.db.
      The CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS and INSERT OR IGNORE statements are used for setup and testing.
      
  ID Extraction from URL:
      The getDataHandler function extracts the ID from the URL path (e.g., /data/1).
      strconv.Atoi converts the ID string to an integer.
      
  Database Query:
      db.QueryRow executes a SQL query to retrieve the data based on the provided ID.
      row.Scan reads the values from the database row into the Data struct.
      
  Error Handling:
      The code includes comprehensive error handling for database operations, ID parsing, and JSON encoding.
      sql.ErrNoRows is handled to return a 404 Not Found response when the ID is not found.
      Internal server errors are logged.
      
  JSON Encoding:
      The retrieved data is encoded into JSON using json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(data).
      
  Content-Type Header:
      The Content-Type header is set to application/json.
      
  Test Data:
      The code now automatically creates and populates the database with test data if it does not already exist. This makes it easier to run and test.
      
  Clearer ID handling:
      The ID is now extracted directly from the URL path, instead of relying on query parameters, which is more RESTful.

# how does json.newencoder work?
To understand `json.NewEncoder`, it's helpful to contrast it with `json.Marshal`. Both are used for converting Go data structures into JSON, but they serve different purposes:

**`json.Marshal`:**

* Takes a Go value as input.
* Returns a byte slice containing the JSON representation of that value.
* It's useful when you need the entire JSON output in memory as a byte slice.

**`json.NewEncoder`:**

* Takes an `io.Writer` as input (e.g., `http.ResponseWriter`, `os.Stdout`, a file).
* Creates a `json.Encoder` that writes JSON directly to that `io.Writer`.
* The `Encoder.Encode()` method then writes the JSON representation of a Go value to the `io.Writer`.
* It's more efficient for streaming JSON data, especially when dealing with large datasets or network connections.

**Here's a breakdown of how `json.NewEncoder` works:**

1.  **Creating the Encoder:**
    * `json.NewEncoder(w)` creates a new `json.Encoder` that will write JSON to the provided `io.Writer` `w`. This `io.Writer` could be anything that implements the `Write([]byte) (int, error)` method, such as an `http.ResponseWriter` for sending JSON over HTTP.

2.  **Encoding Data:**
    * `encoder.Encode(v)` takes a Go value `v` and encodes it into JSON.
    * The encoded JSON is then written directly to the `io.Writer` that was provided when the encoder was created.

3.  **Streaming:**
    * Because it writes directly to an `io.Writer`, `json.NewEncoder` can stream JSON data. This means that it doesn't need to load the entire JSON output into memory before writing it. This is particularly useful when dealing with large amounts of data.

4.  **Efficiency:**
    * For situations where you're writing JSON to a stream (like an HTTP response or a file), `json.NewEncoder` is generally more efficient than `json.Marshal` because it avoids the overhead of creating and holding a large byte slice in memory.

**In essence:**

* `json.Marshal` gives you a JSON byte slice.
* `json.NewEncoder` lets you stream JSON directly to an output destination.

Therefore, when you are working with network connections, and especially http responses, it is much more efficient to use json.NewEncoder.
